      <description>This semester I learned how to use python! One important difference between R studio and python I learned is that indexing in python begins at 0 instead of 1, so it is important to adjust accordingly. For example, if we wanted to find the 4th object in the dataset, we would code like this:
list1=[1,2,3,4] list1[3] ## 4 In addition to learning how python varies from R, I learned how R and Python talk to each other and share information.</description>

      <description>Introduction My project is based on the two datasets “Cross-Sectional Statistics by College Tier and Parent Income Percentile” and “Cross-Sectional Statistics on Children’s Income Distributions by College” produced by opportunity insights research. The datasets were obtained by pulling random samples of students from de-identified federal public tax records in the 1980, 1981, and 1982 birth cohorts. This data was of interest to me because the opportunity gap in our nation between high and low income students is still measurable.</description>

      <description>Introduction This project analyzes the dataset Salaries recording salaries of Assistant Professors, Associate Professors, and Professors in the 2008-2009 school year. There are 6 variables with 397 observations. The 6 variables are rank= ranks if Associate Professor, Assistant Professor, or Professor, discipline= A: &amp;quot;theoretical&amp;quot; departments or B: &amp;quot;applied&amp;quot; departments, yrs.since.phd= years since PhD, yrs.service= years of service, sex= Male or Female, and salary= nine-month salary in dollars. I expect to see a relationship between yrs.</description>
