This semester I learned how to use python! One important difference between R studio and python I learned is that indexing in python begins at 0 instead of 1, so it is important to adjust accordingly. For example, if we wanted to find the 4th object in the dataset, we would code like this:  

```{python}
list1=[1,2,3,4]
list1[3]
```

In addition to learning how python varies from R, I learned how R and Python talk to each other and share information. Check it out! 

```{r}
library(reticulate)
mywords <- "I tell R something"
```

```{python}
mywords = "and python something and boom theyre combined"
print(r.mywords,mywords)
```

```{r}
cat(c(mywords, py$mywords))
```

AND most of all this semester, I learned stackoverflow is my best friend (:
